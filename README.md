# LEECH DETECTOR WITH AUTOBAN FEATURE

This basically is just an extended version of the leech detector by the nicotine+ team.
It doesn't only send a message when someone is leeching, but also bans the user automatically and sends a system notification.
Bans apply to everyone that don't share enough files.

## Requirements
<!--Make sure notify2 (Python) is installed.

For Ubuntu and derivates:
```
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get install -y python3-notify2
```
-->
None, just clone the repo.

## Usage
Copy into `~/.local/share/nicotine/plugins`
and enable it in the settings.

```
git clone https://github.com/z111ck/leechdetector_autoban.git ~/.local/share/nicotine/plugins/leechdetectorautoban
```
